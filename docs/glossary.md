| Deployment                       | A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Containers                       | Lightweight and executable images that consist software and all its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, from a data center to a public or private cloud to your local host.             |
| Node                             | A worker machine in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. A node is either a virtual machine (VM) or a physical machine.                                                                                                                           |
| Operator                         | The preferred method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. An Operator takes human operational knowledge and encodes it into software that is packaged and shared with customers. |
| OperatorHub                      | A platform that contains various OpenShift Container Platform Operators to install.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Pod                              | One or more containers with shared resources, such as volume and IP addresses, running in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster. A pod is the smallest compute unit defined, deployed, and managed.                                                |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | A key security control to ensure that cluster users and workloads have only access to resources required to execute their roles.                                                                                                                       |
| Route                            | Routes expose a service to allow for network access to pods from users and applications outside the OpenShift Container Platform instance.                                                                                                             |
| Service                          | A service exposes a running application on a set of pods.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|serviceAccount|Object that provides an identity for processes running in a Pod. serviceAccounts authenticate against the Kubernetes API using their own credentials that are managed with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).|
